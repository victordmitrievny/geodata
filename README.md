     THE PROJECT IS DEPLOYED ONLINE AT:  <br>
   https://geodata-project.herokuapp.com/ 
</p>
                
      
_**Description:**_

Geodata project collects, stores, formats and visualizes aggregated data on 195 world countries. It allows users to click on the countries to view general country information, view the data on the world map, chart it by 14 different metrics, and explore it in a table. 

Most of the code is written in Python, and the following libraries are used for the project: <br>
-Beautifulsoup <br>
-Pandas <br>
-Sqlalchemy <br>
-Plotly <br>
-Dash <br>

Other technologies used are CSS (minimal), the data is stored on Mysql Server on Heroku and the project is deployed on Heroku

_**Files Summary:**_

-Parsing_wikipedia.py - Parsing the Wikipedia data <br>
-Parsing_iso.py - Parsing iban and doing additional formatting <br>
-Visualization.py - import previous data and visualize with Dash <br>
-Scheduler.py - schedules the programs above to restart every 24 hours <br>
-Assets folder contains logo and css custom styles <br>

To start the program:

1. pip install requirements.txt
2. Launch **Scheduler.py** 

_**Methodology Breakdown:**_

1. Using requests library and beautifulsoup, I Iterate through links to individual country pages on Wikipedia from the Wikipedia’s countries list:

2. With beautifulsoup, I parse and format (using regular expressions + more) each individual country’s data and write it into a dictionary of dictionaries and then convert into pandas dataframe

3. Convert a resulting dictionary into pandas dataframe and write it to a MySQL server stored on Heroku
4. Parse country codes from iban.com in order to be able to plot the data on a map, format the data and add it to the table stored in MySQL

5. Using Dash, I connect the resulting table with a choropleth map from Plotly, and make it interactive through callbacks 

6. Using various Plotly graphs, create a visualization and a datatable 

7. Make a scheduling program that restarts the parsing procedure, formatting, storing and visualization procedure each 24 hours

8. Deploy on Heroku
